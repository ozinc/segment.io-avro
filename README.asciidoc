= Segment Spec Avro Implementation

This project provides a full implementation of the data-types
defined in the https://segment.com/docs/spec[Segment Spec] in AVRO (1.8.x).

= Building

To execute build the AVRO classes run:

```bash
$ mvn compile
```

= Testing

To execute all tests run:

```bash
$ mvn clean test
```

== Adding Additional Test Cases

The test framework by default will try to find a valid AVRO schema for each event (`.json` file)
that is placed in `src/test/resources/com/oz/segmentio/avro` and check that serializing the given
JSON to AVRO and subsequent deserialization of the AVRO encoded data happens without data loss.

If you wish to add a new test event, simple put it into a new file in `src/test/resources/com/oz/segmentio/avro`
and ending in `.json` and the integration tests will pick it up automatically.
